        Welcome to dzook app’s  Privacy Policy!
        <br/><br/>
        Thank you for choosing to be part of our community at 3dzook, Inc. doing business as dzook  (<b>“dzook”</b>, <b>“we”</b>, <b>“us”</b>, or <b>“our”</b>). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about our policy or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at privacy@dzook.ai.

        <b>Welcome to dzook’s Privacy Policy!</b><br/><br/>
        If you decide not to read this entire Privacy Policy, we want you to walk away with a few key points about dzook’s privacy practices:
        <ul>
          <li>The App is an illustrated portrait and video animation creator that allows users to convert simple photos or videos to cartoonish illustrations using filters and features based on our AI algorithm technology that automatically generates illustrated portraits and video animations.</li><br/>
          <li>Due to the limited processing resources available on mobile devices, we use a third-party cloud provider – specifically, Amazon Web Services – to process and transform photographs.</li><br/>
          <li>The App only uploads to the cloud the photographs and videos that you specifically select for editing. Photographs and videos remain in the cloud for a limited period of 48 hours after they are automatically deleted from the cloud.</li><br/>
          <li>We do not use the photographs and videos you provide when you use the App for any reason other than to provide you with the portrait and video converting functionality of the App.</li>
        </ul><br/>
        If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please email privacy@dzook.ai.
